#### ARTICLE IV ASSESSMENTS

4.01 Covenant for Assessments and Creation of Lien and Personal Obligation. Each Owner of a Lot, jointly and severally, for himself, his heirs, distributees, legal representatives, successors and assigns, by acceptance of a deed for a Lot, whether or not the covenants contained herein shall be expressed in any such deed, hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

(a) to pay to the Association the annual assessments which may or shall be levied by the Association pursuant to this Declaration against all Lots owned by him;

(b) to pay to the Association the initial assessment upon the initial sale of a Residence to a third party;

(b) to pay to the Association any special assessments for capital improvements and other charges which may or shall be levied by the Association pursuant to this Declaration against all Lots owned by him;

(c) to pay to the Association any specific assessments for capital improvements and other charges which may or shall be levied by the Association pursuant to this Declaration against any or all Lots owned by him;

(d) that there is hereby created a continuing charge and lien upon all Lots owned by him against which all such assessments are made to secure payment of such assessments and any interest thereon as provided in Section 4.09 hereof and costs of collection including reasonable attorneys' fees;

(e) that such continuing charge and lien on such Lot binds such Lot in the hands of the then Owner, and the Owner's grantees, heirs, devisees, legal representatives, successors and assigns. Such charge and lien is superior to any and all charges, liens or encumbrances which may hereafter in any manner arise or be imposed upon such Lots whether arising from or imposed by judgment or decree or by any agreement, contract, mortgage, deed to secure debt, or other instrument, except (i) such liens for taxes or other public charges as are by applicable law made superior, and (ii) all deeds to secure debt given to secure a loan the proceeds of which are used by the Owner (1) to purchase a Lot or Lots (together with any and all Structures which may from time be placed or located thereon) and (2) to finance the construction repair or alteration of Structures.

(f) that no sale or transfer at foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure shall relieve any Lot from liability for any assessment thereafter assessed;

(g) that all initial, annual, special and specific assessments (together with interest thereon as provided in Section 4.09 of this Declaration and costs of collection including reasonable attorneys' fees) levied against any Lot owned by him during the period that he is an Owner shall be (in addition to being a continuing charge and lien against such Lot as provided in Section 4.01(d) of this Declaration) a personal obligation which will survive any sale or transfer of the Lot owned by him; provided, however, that such personal obligation for delinquent assessments shall not pass to an Owner's successor in title unless expressly assumed by such successor.

4.02 Purpose of Assessment. The assessments levied by the Association shall be used exclusively for the purpose of providing for the common good and general welfare of the people of the new community of the Development, including, but not limited to, the acquisition, construction, improvement, operation, maintenance and equipping of Common Property, the enforcement of the Restrictions contained in this Declaration, the enforcement of the Design Standards of the ACC, the payment of operating costs and expenses of the Association and the payment of all principal and interest when due on all debts owed by the Association.

4.03 Accumulation of Funds Permitted. The Association shall not be obligated to spend in any calendar year all the sums collected in such year by way of annual assessments or otherwise, and may carry forward, as surplus, any balances remaining; nor shall the Association be obligated to apply such surplus to the reduction of the Annual Assessments in any succeeding year, but may carry forward from year such surplus as the Board may deem to be desirable for the greater financial security of the Association and the effectuation of its purposes.

#### 4.04 Annual Assessment.

(a) Beginning on the Date applicable to the first Lot sold and continuing thereafter until January 1 of the year immediately following the Commencement Date, each Lot shall be subject to an annual assessment of Four Hundred and No/100 (\$400.00) Dollars per Lot. In the event that the Commencement Date falls on a day other than January 1, the annual assessment for such year shall be prorated so that each Owner pays an annual assessment proportional to the number of days remaining in the calendar year. The words "Assessment Year" as used herein shall mean the calendar year with the first Assessment Year commencing on January 1 of the year immediately following the Commencement Date. For so long as Declarant owns a Lot, the annual assessment shall not be reduced below \$400.00 without the express written consent of Declarant.

(b) After the first Assessment Year the amount of the annual assessment shall be determined pursuant to Section 4.06 below.

#### 4.05 Special Assessments.

(a) In addition to the annual assessments authorized by this Article IV, the Association may levy, in any Assessment Year and with such frequency as the Association shall deem necessary, special assessments for the purpose of paying, in whole or in part, any unanticipated operating expenses, as well as the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement on the Common Property. Such special assessments may be levied by the Board in any Assessment Year without the approval of the members, which special assessments in the aggregate do not exceed an amount equal to the annual assessment then in effect. Special assessments exceeding said amount shall require the approval of two-thirds (2/3) of the Members of the Association who are present in person or by proxy at a meeting of Members duly held in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws of the Association and this Declaration.

(b) All Members of the Association shall be given written notice by the Board not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days in advance of any meeting of the Members of the Association at which the Board shall propose taking action pursuant to and Section 4.05 (a). Such written notice shall specify under which Section or Sections the Board will propose action. At such meeting, the presence of Members or of proxies entitled to cast one-third (1/3) of the total votes outstanding shall constitute a quorum. If the required quorum is not present at such meeting, a second meeting may be called by the Board subject to the same notice requirement, and the required quorum at such second meeting shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of the total votes outstanding. No such second meeting shall be held more than sixty (60) days following the first meeting. If the required quorum is not present at the second meeting, the Board may take such action without approval of the Members.

#### 4.06 Assessment Procedure.

(a) The Board shall establish the annual assessment for each Assessment Year at an amount as determined by the provisions of this Article IV, and shall also establish the date during the Assessment Year on which the annual assessment shall be due and payable (such date is hereinafter referred to as the "Due Date"). The Board shall also establish an annual budget which shall list the estimated operating expenses and shall contain an amount to be set aside each year into a reserve allowance to be used for future repair and replacement of the Common Property; provided, however, in no event shall the Board be required to provide for a reserve sufficient to cover all such future repair and replacement of the Common Property, it being intended that a portion of such costs may be covered by Special Assessment. The Board shall cause the Association to send to each Owner at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of the budget, a copy of the budget and a written notice setting forth the amount of the annual assessment and the Due Date. After Declarant no longer has the right to appoint or remove members of the Board and officers of the Association, such budget and assessment shall become effective unless disapproved at a meeting by Members representing at least 75% of the total votes in the

Association. If the budget proves inadequate for any reason, the Board may prepare a revised budget for the remainder of the fiscal year, which revised budget shall become effective unless disapproved at a meeting by Members in the same manner as prescribed for the initial budget. There shall be no obligation to call a meeting for the purpose of considering the budget or any revised budget except on petition of the Members as required for special meetings in the By-Laws, which petition must be presented to the Board within 10 days after delivery of the notice of assessments.

If a budget is not adopted for any year, then until such time as a budget is adopted, the budget in effect for the immediately preceding year shall continue for the current year.

The Board may establish reasonable payment procedures to allow or require payment of the annual assessment in installments during the Assessment Year. The Board shall also establish payment procedures for payment of any special assessments for capital improvements which may be levied in accordance with the provisions of this Article IV.

4.07 Uniform Rate of Assessment. Both annual and special assessments must be fixed at a uniform rate for all Lots.

4.08 Declarant's Obligation for Assessments. Declarant shall be exempt from regular annual assessments on all of its unsold Lots. Should Declarant ever be required to pay any type of assessment, Declarant's obligations may be satisfied in the form of cash or by "in kind" contributions of services or materials, or by a combination of these at Declarant's sole discretion. Declarant may make a loan to the Association in the form of cash, or "in kind" contributions of services or material and all of these shall be treated as a loan to the Association. The terms of such loan shall include interest at the Applicable Federal Rate as indicated in the tables published pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 1274, and payment in full shall be due upon demand at any time after the date on which Declarant no longer has the right to appoint or remove members of the Board and officers of the Association.

4.09 Effect of Nonpayment of Assessments. Any Assessment which is not paid on or before the Due Date shall bear interest after the Due Date at the lower of the highest legal rate of interest which can be charged or the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum, or at such rate as the Board may from time to time establish, provided, however, that in no event shall the Board have the power to establish a rate of interest in violation of the State of Georgia. In the event of default in the payment of any one or more installments of an assessment, the Board may declare any remaining balance of the assessment at once due and payable. In the event that an owner shall fail to pay fully any portion of any assessment prior to the date on which payment is due, such unpaid portion (including any remaining balance declared immediately due and payable in accordance with the preceding sentence), together with interest and costs of collection including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be a binding personal obligation of such Owner, as well as a lien on such Owner's Lot enforceable in accordance with the provisions of this Declaration.

4.10 Certificate of Payment. Upon written demand by an Owner, the Association shall within a reasonable period of time issue and furnish to such Owner a written certificate stating that all assessments (including penalties, interest and costs, if any) have been paid with respect to any Lot owned by said Owner as of the date of such certificate, or that all assessments, interest and costs have not been paid, setting forth the amount then due and payable. The Association may make a reasonable charge for the issuance of such certificate. Any such certificate, when duly issued as herein provided, shall be conclusive and binding with regard to any matter therein stated as between the Association and any bona fide purchaser of, or lender on, the Lot in question.

4.11 Approval by Declarant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no special assessment shall be made without the Approval of Declarant for so long as Declarant owns a Lot.

4.12 Specific Assessments. The Board shall have the power to specifically assess any one or more Lots pursuant to this Section as, in its discretion, it shall deem appropriate. Failure of the Board to exercise its authority under this Section shall not be grounds for any action against the Association or the Board and shall not constitute a waiver of the Board's right to exercise its authority under this Section in the future with respect to any expenses, including an expense for which the Board has not previously exercised its authority under this Section. The Board may specifically assess Owners for the following expenses, except for expenses incurred for maintenance and repair of items which are the maintenance responsibility of the Association as provided herein:

(a) Expenses of the Association which benefit less than all of the Lots, which may be specifically assessed equitably among all of the Lots which are benefited according to the benefit received;

(b) Expenses incurred by the Association pursuant to Section 6.14 hereof for the Lots being assessed; and

(c) Reasonable fines as may be imposed in accordance with the terms of the Declaration and By-Laws.

4.13 Initial Assessment. Upon the closing of the initial sale of each Residence to a third party, the Owner of such Residence shall pay a one-time assessment, in addition to the annual assessment, in the amount of \$600.00.

#### ARTICLE XII

### DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND LIMITATION ON LITIGATION

12.01 Agreement to Avoid Costs of Litigation and to Limit Right to Litigate Disputes. The Association, Declarant, all Persons subject to this Declaration, and any Person not otherwise subject to this Declaration who agrees to submit to this Article (collectively, "Bound Parties") agree to encourage the amicable resolution of disputes involving the Property, and to avoid the emotional and financial costs of litigation if at all possible. Accordingly, each Bound Party covenants and agrees that all claims, grievances or disputes between such Bound Party and any other bound Party involving, arising out of or relating to (a) the use, sale, purchase, construction, improvement, maintenance, operation or marketing of the Property; (b) the interpretation, application or enforcement of this Declaration, the By-Laws, or the Articles of Incorporation, or any rules adopted by the Association; (c) the administration, operation, management, use or maintenance of the Association and its assets; or (d) the alleged negligent design, maintenance, development, improvement, construction or operation by Declarant of any portion of the Property (collectively, "Claims"), except for those Exempt Claims described in Section 12.02, shall be resolved using the procedures set forth in Section 12.03 in lieu of filing suit in any court or initiating proceedings before any administrative tribunal seeking redress or resolution of such Claim.

12.02 Exempt Claims. The following Claims ("Exempt Claims") shall be exempt from the provisions of Section 12.03:

(a) any suit by the Association against any Bound Party to enforce the provisions of Article IV (Assessments);

(b) any suit by the Association to obtain a temporary restraining order (or equivalent emergency equitable relief) and such other ancillary relief as the court may

deem necessary in order to maintain the status quo and preserve the Association's ability to enforce the provisions of Article V (Architectural Standards) and Article VI (Use Restrictions);

(c) any suit between Owners that does not include Declarant as a party thereto, if such suit asserts a Claim which would constitute a cause of action under the laws of the State of Georgia or the United States but does not or would not include or involve any claim, right, privilege, membership, or defense based on or arising from the Declaration, By-Laws, Articles or rules of the Association;

(d) any suit in which all indispensable parties are not Bound Parties;

(e) any suit which all the parties thereto agree to consider as an Exempt Claim;

a construction defects claim which involves damages in excess of (f) \$50,000.00 per Lot; and

(g) the submission to a court of any settlement as a settlement affecting a class if such a class settlement is reasonably necessary to resolve a dispute which would otherwise not be an Exempt Claim.

Any Bound Party having an Exempt Claim may submit it to the alternative dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 12.03, but there shall be no obligation to do so. The submission of an Exempt Claim involving the Association to the alternative dispute resolution procedures of Section 12.03 shall require the approval of the Association.

12.03 Mandatory Procedures For All Other Claims. All Claims other than Exempt Claims shall be resolved using the following procedures:

(a) Notice. Any Bound Party having a Claim ("Claimant") against any other Bound Party ("Respondent"), other than an Exempt Claim, shall notify each Respondent in writing of the Claim (the "Notice"), stating plainly and concisely:

- 1. the nature of the Claim, including date, time, location, persons, involved, and Respondent's role in the Claim;
- 2. the basis of the Claim (i.e., the laws, regulations, contract, provisions of this Declaration, the By-Laws, the Articles or rules or other authority out of which the Claim arises);
- what Claimant wants Respondent to do or not do to resolve the Claim; and 3.
- 4. that Claimant will meet in person with Respondent at a mutually agreeable time and place to discuss in good faith ways to resolve the Claim.

- Negotiation. (b)
- 1. Each Claimant and Respondent (the "Parties") shall make every reasonable effort to meet in person and confer for the purpose of resolving the Claim by good faith negotiation.
- 2. Upon receipt of a written request from any Party, accompanied by a copy of the Notice, the Board may appoint a representative to assist the Parties in resolving the dispute by negotiation, if in its discretion it believes its efforts will be beneficial to the Parties and to the welfare of the community.
- Mediation. (c)
- ﻨ If the Parties do not resolve the Claim through negotiation within 30 days of the date of the Notice (or within such other period as may be agreed upon by the Parties) ("Termination of Negotiations"), Claimant shall have 30 additional days within which to submit the Claim to mediation under the auspices of an independent dispute resolution center, the Neighborhood Justice Center of Atlanta, or such other independent agency providing similar services in the Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area upon which the Parties may mutually agree.
- If Claimant does not submit the Claim to mediation within 30 days after လံ Termination of Negotiations, Claimant shall be deemed to have waived the Claim, and Respondent shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to Claimant on account of such Claim; provided, nothing herein shall release or discharge Respondent from any liability to Persons not a Party to the foregoing proceedings.
- 3. If the Parties do not settle the Claim within 30 days after submission of the matter to the mediation process, or within such time as determined reasonable or appropriate by the mediator, the mediator shall issue a notice of termination of the mediation proceedings ("Termination of Mediation"). The Termination of Mediation notice shall set forth when and where the Parties met, that the Parties are at an impasse, and the date that mediation was terminated.
- 4. Each party shall, within 15 days of the Termination of Mediation, make a written offer of settlement in an effort to resolve the Claim. The Claimant shall made a final written settlement demand ("Settlement Demand") to the Respondent. The Respondent shall make a final written settlement offer ("Settlement Offer") to the Claimant. If the Claimant fails to make a Settlement Demand, Claimant's original Notice shall constitute the

Settlement Demand. If the Respondent fails to make a Settlement Offer, Respondent shall be deemed to have made a "zero" or "taking nothing" Settlement Offer.

- Final and Binding Arbitration. (d)
- 1. If the Parties do not agree in writing to accept either the Settlement Demand, the Settlement Offer, or otherwise resolve the Claim within 30 days of the Termination of Mediation, the Claimant shall have 15 additional days to submit the Claim to arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration contained in Exhibit "B" or the Claim shall be deemed abandoned, and Respondent shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to Claimant arising out of such Claim; provided, nothing herein shall release or discharge Respondent from any liability to Persons not a Party to the foregoing proceedings.
- 2. This subsection (d) is an agreement of the Bound Parties to arbitrate all Claims except Exempt Claims and is specifically enforceable under the applicable arbitration laws of the State of Georgia. The arbitration award (the "Award") shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court of competent jurisdiction to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the State of Georgia.

### 12.04 Allocation of Costs of Resolving Claims.

(a) Each Party shall bear its own costs incurred prior to and during the proceedings described in Section 12.03(a), (b) and (c), including the fees of its attorney or other representative. Each Party shall share equally all charges rendered by the mediator(s) pursuant to Section 12.03(c).

(b) Each Party shall bear its own costs (including the fees of its attorney or other representative) incurred after the Termination of Mediation under Section 12.03(c) and shall share equally all costs of conducting the arbitration proceeding (collectively, "Post Mediation Costs"), except as otherwise provided in subsection 12.04(c).

(c) Claimant shall prepay to the arbitration panel the sum of \$2,000.00 to be applied toward payment of any Post-Mediation Costs of the Parties, and, in addition, shall advance all arbitration costs until an Award is made. If a Respondent brings a Claim (i.e., a counterclaim) against a Claimant, the arbitration panel may, upon request, order such Respondent to advance a portion of the arbitration costs. If an Award is equal to or more favorable to a Claimant than such Claimant's Settlement Demand, the arbitration panel may, in its discretion, add all or a portion of such Claimant's Post-Mediation Costs to the Award, and allocate such Costs to the Respondents in such proportions as the arbitration panel deems appropriate. If an Award against a Respondent is equal to or less favorable

to Claimant than such Respondent's Settlement Offer to that Claimant, the arbitration panel may, in its discretion, also award to such Respondent its Post-Mediation Costs, and allocate such Post-Mediation Costs to the Claimants in such proportions as the arbitration panel deems appropriate.

12.05 Enforcement of Resolution. After resolution of any Claim through negotiation, mediation or arbitration, in accordance with Section 12.03, if any Party fails to abide by the terms of any agreement or Award, then any other Party may file suit or initiate administrative proceedings to enforce such agreement or Award without the need to again comply with the procedures set forth in Section 12.03. In such event, the Party taking action to enforce the agreement or Award shall be entitled to recover from the non-complying Party (or if more than one non-complying Party, from all such Parties pro rata) all costs incurred in enforcing such agreement or Award, including, without limitation, attorneys fees and court costs.

12.06 Declarant's Right to Suspend or Terminate. So long Declarant retains the right to appoint officers and directors to the Board, Declarant shall retain the right, from time in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate this Article as to any and all proceedings not yet underway, by recording a notice of such suspension or termination in the public records of the county where the Property is located as a supplement to this Declaration.

If for any reason either the amount of the insurance proceeds to be paid as a result of such damage or destruction, or reliable and detailed estimates of the cost of repair or reconstruction, or both, are not made available to the Association within such period, then the period shall be extended until such information shall be made available; provided, however, such extension shall not exceed one hundred and twenty (120) days. No Mortgagee shall have the right to participate in the determination of whether damage or destruction shall be repaired or reconstructed.

If the damage or destruction for which the insurance proceeds are paid is to be repaired or reconstructed and such proceeds are not sufficient to defray the cost thereof, the Board shall, without the necessity of a vote of the Association's Members, levy a special assessment. Additional assessments may be made in like manner at any time during or following the completion of any repair or reconstruction. If the funds available from insurance exceed the costs of repair or reconstruction or if the improvements are not repaired or reconstructed, such excess shall be deposited for the benefit of the Association

In the event that it should be determined by the Association in the manner described above that the damage or destruction shall not be repaired or reconstructed and no alternative improvements are authorized, then in that event the property shall be restored to its natural state and maintained as an undeveloped portion of the Community in a neat and attractive condition.

(c) shall, in the event of damage or destruction, be allocated among the persons who are

responsible hereunder for maintenance of the damaged or destroyed property.

Section 6. Voting. Each Unit shall be entitled to one equal vote, which vote may be cast by the Owner's spouse, the cohabitant of the Owner, or by a lawful proxy as provided below. When more than one (1) Person owns a Unit, the vote for such Unit shall be exercised as they determine between or among themselves, but in no event shall more than one ( ) vote be cast with respect to any Unit. If only one ( ) co-owner attempts to cast the vote for a Unit, it shall be conclusively presumed that such co-owner is authorized on behalf of all co-owners to cast the vote for such Unit. In the event of disagreement between or among co-owners and an attempt by two (2) or more of them to cast such vote or votes, such Persons shall not be recognized and such vote or votes shall not be counted. No Owner shall be eligible to vote, either in person or by proxy, or to be elected to the Board of Directors, if that Owner is shown on the books or management accounts of the Association to be more than thirty (30) days delinquent in any payment due the Association or if the Owner has had its voting rights suspended for the infraction of any provision of the Declaration, these Bylaws, or any rule of the Association. If the voting rights of an Owner have been suspended, that Owner shall not be counted as an eligible vote for purposes of establishing a Majority or a quorum.

Section 7. Majority. As used in these Bylaws, the term "majority" shall mean those votes, Owners, or other group as the context may indicate totaling more than fifty (50%) percent of the total number of eligible votes, or other group, respectively. Unless otherwise specifically stated, the words "majority vote" mean more than fifty (50%) percent of those voting in person or by proxy. Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Declaration or these Bylaws, all decisions shall be by majority vote.

Section 8. Purpose. The Association shall have the responsibility of administering the Association, establishing the means and methods of collecting the contributions to the Common Expenses, arranging for the management of the Association and performing all of the other acts that may be required to be performed by the Association pursuant to the Georgia Nonprofit Corporation Code and the Declaration.

the Board of Directors, or upon written petition of Owners holding at least twenty-five (25%) percent of the total Association vote. Any such written petition by the members must be submitted to the Association's Secretary.

Section 3. Notice of Meetings.

The notice shall state the purpose of any special meeting, as well as the time and place where it is to be held. The notice of an annual meeting shall state the time and place of the meeting. If any Owner wishes notice to be given at an address other than his or her Unit, the Owner shall have designated by notice in writing to the Secretary such other address. The mailing or delivering of a notice of meeting in the manner provided in this Section shall be considered proper service of notice.

Section 4. Waiver of Notice. Waiver of notice of meeting of the Owners shall be deemed the equivalent of proper notice. Any Owner may, in writing, waive notice of any meeting of the Owners, either before or after such meeting. Attendance at a meeting by an Owner, whether in person or represented by proxy, shall be deemed waived by such Owner of notice of the time, date, and place thereof unless such Owner specifically objects to lack of proper notice at the time the meeting is called to order. Attendance at a special meeting shall also be deemed waiver of notice of all business transacted at such meeting unless objection to lack of notice is raised before the business, of which proper notice was not given, is put to a vote.

Section 5. Quorum. Except as may be provided elsewhere, the presence of Owners. in person or by proxy, entitled to cast one-third (1/3) of the eligible votes of the Association shall constitute a quorum. Once a quorum is established for a meeting, it shall conclusively be presumed to exist until the meeting is adjourned and shall not need to be reestablished. Owners whose voting rights have been suspended pursuant to the Declaration or these Bylaws shall not be counted as eligible votes toward the quorum requirement.

Section 6. Adjournment. Any meeting of the Owners may be adjourned from time to time for periods not exceeding ten (10) days by vote of the Owners holding the Majority of the votes represented at such meeting, regardless of whether a quorum is present. Any business which could be transacted properly at the original session of the meeting may be transacted at a reconvened session, and no additional notice of such reconvened session shall be required.

Section 7. Proxy. Any member entitled to vote may do so by written proxy duly executed by the member setting forth the meeting at which the proxy is valid. To be valid, a proxy must be signed, dated, and filed with the Secretary prior to the opening of the meeting for which it is to be used. Proxies may be delivered to the Board by personal delivery, U.S. mail or facsimile transmission to any Board member or the property manager. Proxies may be revoked only by written notice delivered to the Association, except that the presence in person by the giver of a proxy at a meeting for which the proxy is given shall automatically invalidate the proxy for that meeting. A proxy holder may not appoint a substitute proxy holder unless expressly authorized to do so in the proxy.

Section 8. Action Taken Without a Meeting. In the discretion of the Board, any action that may be taken at any annual, regular, or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the Association delivers a written consent form or ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter.

(a) A written ballot shall: (1) set forth each proposed action; and (2) provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action.

(b) Approval by written ballot pursuant hereto shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

(c) All solicitations for votes by written ballot shall: (1) Indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements; (2) State the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors; and (3) Specify the time by which a ballot must be received by the corporation in order to be counted.

Any rule or regulation may be repealed by the affirmative vote or written consent of a Majority of the total Association vote at an annual or special meeting of the membership. Every Owner and Occupant shall comply with the Declaration, Bylaws and regulations of the Association, and any lack of compliance therewith shall entitle the Association and, in an appropriate case, one or more aggrieved Unit Owners, to take action to enforce the terms of the Declaration Bylaws or rules and regulations.

The Board shall have the power to impose reasonable fines, which shall constitute a lien upon the Owner's Unit, and to suspend an Owners right to vote or to use the Common Element for violation of any duty imposed under the Declaration, these Bylaws,

or any rules and regulations duly adopted hereunder; provided, however, nothing herein shall authorize the Association or the Board to limit ingress and egress to or from a Unit. In the event that any Occupant of a Unit violates the Declaration, Bylaws, or a rule or regulation and a fine is imposed, notice of such violation shall be sent to the Owner and Occupant and the fine shall first be assessed against such Occupant; provided, however, if the fine is not paid by the Occupant within the time period set by the Board, the Unit Owner shall pay the fine upon notice from the Association, and the fine shall be an assessment and a lien against the Unit until paid. The failure of the Board to enforce any provision of the Declaration, Bylaws, or any rule or regulation shall not be deemed a waiver of the right of the Board to do so thereafter.

Section 2. Fining and Suspension Procedure\_The Board shall not impose a fine, suspend the right to vote or suspend the right m use the Property (provided, however, if an Owner is shown on the books or management accounts of the Association to be more than thirty (30) days delinquent in any payment due the Association, suspension of the right to vote and the right to use the Property shall be automatic; provided further, however, suspension of common utility services shall require compliance with the provisions of Article XIII, Section 6 of the Declaration, where applicable), unless and until the Association has sent or delivered written notice to the violator as provided in subsection (a) below. Any such fine or fines may be effective or commence upon the sending of such notice or such later date as may be set forth in such notice, notwithstanding the violator's right to request a hearing before the Board to challenge such fine under subsection (b) below.

(a) Notice. If any provision of the Declaration or Bylaws or any rule or regulation of the Association is violated, the Board shall send the violator written notice identifying the violation and fine(s) being imposed and advising the violator of the right to request a hearing before the Board to contest the violation or fine(s) or to request reconsideration of the fine(s). Fine(s) may be effective or commence upon the sending of such notice or such later date specified in such notice, notwithstanding the violator's right to request a hearing before the Board to challenge the fine. In the event of a continuing violation, each day the violation continues or occurs again constitutes a separate offense, and fines may be imposed on a per diem basis without further notice to the violator.

(b) Hearing. If a written request for hearing is received from the violator within ten (10) days of the date of the violation notice provided above, then the Board shall schedule and hold in executive session a hearing affording the violator a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The minutes of the meeting shall contain a written statement of the results of the hearing.

regulations or by suit at law or in equity to enjoin any violation or to recover monetary damages or both without the necessity for compliance with the procedure set forth in Section (2) of this Article. In any such action, to the maximum extent permissible, the Owner or Occupant responsible for the violation for which abatement is sought shall pay all costs, including reasonable attorney's fees actually incurred.

The Association or its duly authorized agent shall have the power to enter a Unit or upon any portion of the Property to abate or remove, using such force as may be reasonably necessary, any structure, thing or condition which violates the Declaration, the Bylaws, or the rules and regulations; provided, however, written notice shall be given to the Owner of the Unit at least two (2) days prior to the time that any items of construction are altered or demolished. All costs of self-help, including reasonable attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the violating Unit Owner and shall be collected as provided herein for the collection of assessments.
